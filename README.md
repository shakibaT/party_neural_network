# party_neural_network

This script aims to find an optimal seating arrangement for a party, minimizing conflicts between guests.

## Problem Description:

We have a party with 24 guests.
Seating will be arranged in a 4x6 grid (4 rows, 6 columns).
Certain guest pairs have conflicts and cannot sit next to each other (vertically or horizontally).
40 conflict pairs exist between the guests.

## Goal:

Develop a program to generate a seating arrangement that minimizes the number of conflicts between seated guests using neural networks.
